2;tonic;Macario Tonica;;;https://ginventory.reed.be/api/v2/products/2/picture?type=normal;Macario S.r.l.;Italy;;7.5;28.0;In the Fifties, at Macario family, during summer afternoons, grandmother Vittoria used to prepare refreshing drinks for adults and children. Ingredients were simple and natural, with unforgettable flavours, and the taster was always pleased. Macario family then decided to start a small homemade production, to allow other people to taste the good drinks created by grandmother Vittoria. For some years the business went well and gained in popularity towards the consumers, but the senior founder suddendly had to quit the business. The legend of that adventure, along with the memory of his grandmother and her recipes, nowadays has drawn one of the grandsons to restart this project, by maintaining the same spirit of those times.;False;

This just doesn’t do our gin loving ancestors’ tonics any justice. Our Tonic, however, is made completely by hand from whole ingredients right out of the history book. Where others go for powdered quinine or “tonic flavorings,” we went right to the source and created this tonic from whole spices, real citrus oil, and exclusively imported Peruvian cinchona bark. This stuff is the real deal.
Due to the nature of the raw ingredients, there’s a much more complex and layered flavor profile than the tonics we’ve become accustomed to. The Peruvian cinchona bark lends a very warm and earthy bitterness and rounds out the subtle sweetness and acidity of this tonic which adds a layer of depth to the experience. It then finishes with the delicate flavor of real cold-pressed orange oil. No extracts here. No corners cut.";False;

In colonial India, people came up with the idea to make the healthy drink palatable with gin. This way, the Gin & Tonic was born!
